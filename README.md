# leaflet-challenge

This leaflet challenge was an exercise in visualization!  It was really rewarding to see the code come together into an interactive visualization.  The challenge I had was figuring out how to incorporate the grayscale map, since it required a token to work.  I did find the information on the mapbox website for LeafletJS implementation, and it really helped me a lot.  I am really excited to implement this knowledge in our Project 3 coming up.

Thank you for looking at my work!
